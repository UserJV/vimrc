# .vimrc
My simple .vimrc file.

It is worth remembering that I use Vundle to install the plugins. If you don't have it on your machine, see how to install it below using Git.

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Some plugins require Nodejs, NPM and Curl. Make sure they are installed on your machine.
